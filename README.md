# HEART FAILURE PREDICTION 

## Overview
This Machine Learning project aims to assess the likelihood of a death event due to heart failure. The model can assist hospitals in evaluating the severity of patients with cardiovascular diseases.

## About the Dataset
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths globally. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs, and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality from heart failure.

Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioral risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet, obesity, physical inactivity, and harmful use of alcohol through population-wide strategies.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or already established disease) need early detection and management, where a machine learning model can be of great help.

## What Input Data is Required?
The model takes the following 12 variables as input:
- **Age**
- **Anaemia**
- **Creatinine Phosphokinase**
- **Diabetes**
- **Ejection Fraction**
- **High Blood Pressure**
- **Platelets**
- **Serum Creatinine**
- **Serum Sodium**
- **Sex**
- **Smoking**
- **Follow-Up Time in Hospital**

## How to Upload Data for Prediction?
1. **Manual Entry:** Suitable for single patient prediction via sliders and text fields.
2. **CSV File Upload:** Suitable for multiple predictions at the same time. Upload a `.csv` file in the specified format.
